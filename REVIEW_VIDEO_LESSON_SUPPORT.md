# Are these changes enough for video lesson support?

**Backend:**
- The backend now supports a `videoUrl` field for lessons (in the Course model and in the lesson creation logic).
- The controller for adding a lesson (`addLessonToSection`) checks for `type === "Video"` and saves the `videoUrl` if provided.

**Frontend:**
- (Assuming you updated the lesson creation form to include a "Video URL" field and send it as part of the lesson data.)
- (Assuming you render the video using the `videoUrl` in the lesson view/player.)

**What else to check for a complete, robust solution:**
1. **Frontend Form:**  
   - The lesson creation form should show the "Video URL" input only if "Video" is selected as the lesson type.
   - The form should validate that a URL is provided for video lessons.

2. **Frontend Playback:**  
   - When displaying a lesson of type "Video", the frontend should render a `<video>` tag or an `<iframe>` for Google Drive/YouTube links.
   - For Google Drive, you may need to convert the share link to an embeddable link.

3. **Security:**  
   - Validate the `videoUrl` on the backend (optional, but recommended).
   - Ensure only instructors/admins can add lessons.

4. **User Experience:**  
   - Show clear error messages if the video cannot be loaded.
   - Optionally, allow uploading videos directly (not just by URL) in the future.

**Summary:**  
- The backend changes are sufficient for storing and retrieving video lesson URLs.
- The frontend must handle form input and video playback for a complete user experience.
- If you have implemented the frontend changes as described, then **yes, these changes are enough** for basic video lesson support using Google Drive or YouTube links.

# Will you be able to play the video?

**Yes, you will be able to play the video inside each section if:**
- The lesson's `type` is `"Video"` and the `videoUrl` is provided and valid.
- The frontend renders the video using a `<video>` tag for direct links (e.g., `.mp4`) or an `<iframe>` for Google Drive/YouTube links.
- The embed logic (as shown in the previous suggestions) is implemented in your lesson/section view.

**Google Drive/YouTube:**  
- For Google Drive, the link must be converted to the `/preview` format for embedding.
- For YouTube, the link must be converted to the `/embed/VIDEO_ID` format.

**If you use the provided frontend logic, the video will play inside the section as expected.**
